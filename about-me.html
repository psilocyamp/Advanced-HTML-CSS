        Most caterpillars have cylindrical bodies consisting of multiple
        segments, with three pairs of true legs on the thorax and several pairs
        of short, fleshy prolegs on the abdomen. The head has six small eyes
        (stemmata) on each side that function in light detection but not in
        image formation. They have short segmented antennae and strong jaws.
